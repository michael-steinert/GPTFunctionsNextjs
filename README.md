# GPT Functions NextJs

## GPT Functions

- GPT Functions are used to contextualize Arguments from Prompts. This allows GPT Functions to turn natural Language into API Calls
- GPT Functions are defined Function that can be called from the AI to improve the Interaction between it and external Tools and APIs

## Benefits of GPT Functions

- **Function Description**: Developers can describe certain Functions to the AI Model. This means they can tell the AI what Kind of Tasks or Actions they want it to perform.
- **JSON Object Output**: When the AI Model determines that a particular Function needs to be called based on the User's Input, it can output a JSON Object
- **Reliable Connection with External Tools**: By Outputting a JSON Object with the necessary Arguments for the Function Call, the AI can more reliably connect with external Tools and APIs
- **Fine-Tuning for Function Detection and Response**: The AI Model have been fine-tuned to detect when a Function needs to be called, which is Contingent on the User's Input. They have also been fine-tuned to respond with JSON that adheres to the Function Signature
- **Structured Data**: Developers can get structured Data back from the AI Model, meaning the Information returned by the AI is organized in a predictable Way, which makes it easier to handle programmatically
